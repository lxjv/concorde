Hi! I'm Laker. I don't like talking about myself. This is going to be fun.

I'm a student living in England, planning to go into music after 6th form.
I've been creative my entire life, but started writing about 3 years ago.

I came out as non-binary in 2018, and [later as a trans woman in 2022](/out).

imagine this page is longer, i'll finish it eventually. Thanks :D
