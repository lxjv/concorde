Hi! I'm Laker. I don't like talking about myself. This is going to be fun.

I'm a student living in England, planning to go into music after 6th form.
I've been creative my entire life, but started writing about 3 years ago.

I'm also learning how to program, and if any of it actually works I'll put it up on [GitHub](/git)

I first came out as non-binary in 2018, and [later as a trans woman in 2022](/out)
