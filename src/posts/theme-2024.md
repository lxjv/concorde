In November, I wrote a note. It was called [Age of Reinvention](https://la.pika.page/posts/age-of-reinvention).

It was a letter to myself and members of my family.

In December/January, I found out about **yearly themes** by a few people on Mastodon linking to the [Cortex podcast episode](https://overcast.fm/+E7b7wf3Mc) and it made me think about this note again.

I'm not a huge fan of resolutions ([I still do them...](/yearend-2023))
