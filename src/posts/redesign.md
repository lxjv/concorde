I've spent the last month redesigning my website, after [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me) *(who i've mentioned on this blog more times than I've mentioned myself at this point XD)* redesigned his and it gave me the itch. I'd also never used [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) before so I went along with [Zach Leatherman](https://zachleat.com)'s [6-minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzf9A9tkkl4) and I was off on my way.
